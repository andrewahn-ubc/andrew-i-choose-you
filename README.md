# My new personal website!!

Inspired by old-school Nintendo Pokemon games ^-^ Built using Phaser 3, React, and TypeScript.

# Features
### Code-free layout customization! 
Create an 80 x 80 CSV file containing the layout you want and upload it to /public to customize the map however you'd like. Think of it like creating a new Clash of Clans base! Here's an example (I'm using Google Sheets to generate the CSV but you can use whatever you'd like):

<img width="1454" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64bbd400-2786-47ca-b726-78281ca6ed66" />
Legend:
- 0: nothing
- 1: tree
- 2: path

<br>


# TODO
- take care of more edge cases for path generation (the one where 3 sides and 1 corner are path)
- populate the scene with houses, bushes, NPCs, rocks, flowers, and signs
- create elements that can generate popups
- implement collision detection
- if the player stops moving while facing a non-down direction, leave them standing in that direction
- other scenes (when the player "enters" a house, for example)
